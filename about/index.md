I am a statistician, dog mother and roommate to my husband, in that order! I love learning new things, trying out different cuisines (very easy way to avoid cooking!), watching streaming content and playing with our dog. In my free time, I act as a data point (I believe a good one, as I sometimes click on a suggested/recommended options and sometimes search something very different resulting in a good probability distribution or stochastic process over time, I hope) for the recommender systems: I am either in a rabbit hole on youtube or amazon or I am watching a new show on Netflix. My favorite genres are crime thriller and comedy. I also love bollywood movies and am obsessed with the entire movie making process. If I start blogging, I can totally see a large portion of those being about bollywood. I also try to read books as much as I can. To be completely frank though, I do not think I am doing a very good job of that the past few years! :disappointed: Finally, thanks to my husband, we also play a lot of board games. I have tried to compile my list of favorites of the past year below.
